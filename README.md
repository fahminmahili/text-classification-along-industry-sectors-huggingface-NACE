A sophisticated text classification project leveraging the BERT (bert-base-uncased) Hugging Face model to categorize unstructured job postings based on the NACE (Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community) nomenclature. Achieve accurate and efficient industry sector classification with advanced natural language processing techniques.

## Overview

In today's dynamic job market, efficiently categorizing diverse job postings into industry sectors is a crucial task. This project addresses this challenge through the application of cutting-edge natural language processing using the BERT Hugging Face model. The model is trained to understand the nuances of job descriptions and classify them into relevant industry sectors based on the standardized NACE nomenclature.

## Features

- **BERT Hugging Face Model:** Utilizes the powerful bert-base-uncased model for accurate and context-aware text classification.
  
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Ensures the unstructured job postings dataset is well-prepared for effective model training.

- **Similarity Checking:** Validates the model's understanding by checking the similarity between the job postings dataset and the NACE dataset.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Enhances user experience with a straightforward and efficient interface for seamless classification.

- **Google Colab Integration:** The model development and training were conducted on Google Colab, leveraging the platform's robust infrastructure for machine learning projects.

- **Python Implementation:** The entire project is implemented using Python, leveraging its rich ecosystem of libraries and tools for machine learning and natural language processing.
